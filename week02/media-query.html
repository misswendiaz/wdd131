            <h2>Doctrine and Covenants 3:7-10</h2>
            <p>7 For, behold, you should not have feared man more than God. Although men set at naught the counsels of God, and despise his words—</p>
            <p>8 Yet you should have been faithful; and he would have extended his arm and supported you against all the fiery darts of the adversary; and he would have been with you in every time of trouble.</p>
            <p>9 Behold, thou art Joseph, and thou wast chosen to do the work of the Lord, but because of transgression, if thou art not aware thou wilt fall.</p>
            <p>10 But remember, God is merciful; therefore, repent of that which thou hast done which is contrary to the commandment which I gave you, and thou art still chosen, and art again called to the work;</p>

            <h2>Doctrine and Covenants 19:16-20</h2>
            <p>16 For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent;</p>
            <p>17 But if they would not repent they must suffer even as I;</p>
            <p>18 Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit—and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink—</p>
            <p>19 Nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men.</p>
            <p>20 Wherefore, I command you again to repent, lest I humble you with my almighty power; and that you confess your sins, lest you suffer these punishments of which I have spoken, of which in the smallest, yea, even in the least degree you have tasted at the time I withdrew my Spirit.</p>
